Weekend Assignment

Create a user database (login, password, and last login timestamp) class (see problems 7-5 and 9-12) that manages a system requiring users to log in before access to resources is allowed. This database class manages its users, loading any previously saved user information on instantiation and providing accessor functions to add or update database information. This database also supports entries to be deleted.

As discussed, please also complete the regex dates assignment and the 2 problems on HackerRank related to Classes. So, there are three items in total.
